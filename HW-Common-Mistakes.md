Dear Students, 

1. Please, do not leave **install.packages** in the chunk/script/file.

2. Using **read.csv()** is mandatory as I cannot run your code without it.

3. You should use the same (correct) data name in the whole file (e.g. do not assign the data to **df** and use **dt**).

4. Add your interpretations outside of chanks without #s.

5. You **need to knit** your code before submitting, to make sure that your code works.

6. Try to be short in conclusions and interpretations!

7. Please, write your **full names** as a file name (e.g. HW1_Lusine_Zilfimian.Rmd)

8. HTML HW file is illustrative, you need to work in .Rmd file format.

9. Your file path should be reproducible, see below

* Bad path:
**df <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Vazgen\\Desktop\\Tanyin\\Vazgen111\\surveydata.csv")**
* Good path:
**df <- read.csv("surveydata.csv")** #as .Rmd and .csv are in the same file.

10. Read and learn and use the info from [The book of R](https://github.com/data-mining-ysu-spring-2020/Bibliography/blob/master/The%20book%20of%20R.pdf) pages **254-255** (*When Package Objects Clash; Unmounting Packages*).

Regards,

Lusine Zilfimian
